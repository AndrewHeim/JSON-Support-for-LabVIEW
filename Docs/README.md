# JSON Support For LabVIEW

LabVIEW has primitives for casting LabVIEW data to a JSON string and for casting a JSON string to LabVIEW data, but there is no good solution for dynamically creating JSON data or parsing a JSON string whose contents are unknown. JSON Support For LabVIEW addresses this by adding a JSON Value datatype as well as an API for creating, modifying, and reading JSON objects.
